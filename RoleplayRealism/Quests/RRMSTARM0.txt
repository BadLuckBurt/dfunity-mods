Quest: RRMSTARM0
DisplayName: Rumors from the Mountains
QRC:

QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce> Rumors have reached us from guild colleagues in the mountains
<ce> concerning a famed smith who is a master of armor crafting.
<ce>
<ce> It seems that a while back %g just simply vanished and no one
<ce> has heard anything of %g2 since. Recently some reports have
<ce> been received from over in the ____guild_ regarding
<ce> some noble whose soldiers and personal guard have been seen
<ce> clad in impressive armor by several locals. The guild smiths
<ce> think that the descriptions sound very similar in style to,
<ce> and could very well be, the work of this missing master
<ce> armor smith.
<ce> 
<ce> So we suspect that there's something rather fishy going on here,
<ce> and our opinion is that it requires attention from a guild master.
<ce>
<ce> Would you be willing to head over there to investigate and
<ce> deal with the situation, before a guild member with less skill
<ce> and experience makes a mess of things?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce> Okay, I understand that as a guild master you're too busy
<ce> to drop everything to investigate every silly rumor that
<ce> surfaces. Of course we all respect that, however I really
<ce> think this is worth the attention of a guild master, otherwise
<ce> I wouldn't have mentioned it to you. Hopefully one of the
<ce> other guild masters will be willing to deal with it.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce> Great, thank you Master %pct. We're convinced that this is 
<ce> worth further investigation. Please head over to the 
<ce> guild hall in __guild_ in the ____guild_ to see 
<ce> what you discover. There will be a contact waiting for you  
<ce> there whoy will bring you up to speed regarding the 
<ce> situation. They'll wait for your arrival for six months, 
<ce> after that they'll likely try to deal with the situation 
<ce> themselves, and probably bungle it which is best avoided.
<ce>
<ce> Hopefully this will lead you to this lost master armorer.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce> The guild is disappointed that you were unable to find the time to
<ce> investigate what was going on over in the ____guild_.
<ce>
<ce> Hopefully it was nothing unsavory, and the missing armorer is
<ce> simply living out his days quietly somewhere.

 _qgiver_ of the Fighters Guild in ___qgiver_
 informed me about some rumors regarding a master 
 armorer who's not been seen for rather a long time.
    I've agreed to investigate and need to travel  
 to __guild_ in the ____guild_ to see if 
 I can find out what is going on and whether or not 
 it's actually connected with %g3 disappearance.

On %qdt:
 You were able to make time to head over to the guild
 in __guild_ of the ____guild_ to investigate.
 Hopefully it will lead to the missing armorer.

Message: 1012
On %qdt:
 You were unable to find time to investigate what was 
 going on over in the ____guild_. Hopefully it was 
 nothing untoward, and the missing armorer is simply
 living out his days somewhere peacefully.

Message: 1020
<ce> Do you think you'll be able to go to __guild_ and investigate
<ce> the rumors from ____guild_ soon, Master %pct?

Message: 1021
<ce> You have arrived at __guild_ where the rumors regarding 
<ce> the lost armorer surfaced. You should head over to the
<ce> local guild hall to meet the contact who's waiting for
<ce> your arrival.
