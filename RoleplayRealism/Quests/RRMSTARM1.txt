<ce>                Rumors have reached the guild concerning a famed
<ce>                master Armorer by the name of _armorer_.
<ce>                Seems %g simply vanished a while back and no one
<ce>                has heard anything of %g2 since. Recently some reports
<ce>                have surfaced regarding a noble whos personal guard
<ce>                have been seen wearing very high quality armor that 
<ce>                the guild smiths think sounds very much like it could
<ce>                very well be %g3 work which would be strange for someone
<ce>                who's been missing for so long - something's fishy here.
<ce> 
<ce>                Maybe you could head over there and investigate?

<ce>                Well I suppose you're just too busy to drop
<ce>                everything to go and investigate every silly
<ce>                rumor that surfaces, but we really thought
<ce>                this one was worth the effort to investigate 
<ce>                otherwise we wouldn't have mentioned it.
<ce>
<ce>                I'm sure someone else will be interested.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                Good show, %pct. We're convinced that this is worthwhile
<ce>                investigating further. Head over to _palace_ in __palace_
<ce>                and see what you can find.
<ce>
<ce>                Hopefully it will lead you to _armorer_.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                   _armorer_? Where is %g? Why haven't
<ce>                    you brought %g2 back yet? If you
<ce>                      would save %g3 life, go now!

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                   _armorer_! You are alive and well!
<ce>                    %pcf, I owe you a debt that can
<ce>                   never be fully repaid. This modest
<ce>                     reward is the least that I can
<ce>                               give you.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
<ce>                The guards over at the _palace_
<ce>                in __palace_ have such fancy 
<ce>                armor. I wonder where they get such 
<ce>                workmanship?

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
<ce>                You're that %ra that rescued the master
<ce>                armorer _armorer_ from 
<ce>                __palace_. Bloody nobility, think
<ce>                they can treat commoners like dirt and
<ce>                get away with it. Praise be for champions
<ce>                like you.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
<ce>                  The savior of my child! I thank you
<ce>                   and _armorer_ thanks you for saving
<ce>                       %g3 life. Bless you %pcf.

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>                   My child _armorer_ is dead because
<ce>                 of you! Never darken my doorway again.

QuestLogEntry: [1010]
On %qdt:
 _qgiver_ of the Fighters Guild in ___qgiver_
 told me of some rumors regarding a master armorer
 called _armorer_ who has not been seen 
 for a long time.
 I've decided to investigate the _palace_ at __palace_
 to see if I can find out what's going on and 
 whether or not it's connected with %g3 disapearance.

Message: 1011
<ce>                         _palace_ is dark and
<ce>                      ominous. It is certain that
<ce>                        enemies lurk everywhere.

Message:  1020
<ce>                No one messes with the Dark Brotherhood
<ce>                               and lives!

Message: 1021
<ce>                 Are you here to rescue me? My name is
<ce>                         _armorer_. I don't like
<ce>                   these people.
