<ce>                Rumors have reached the guild concerning a famed
<ce>                master Armorer by the name of _armorer_.
<ce>                Seems %g simply vanished a while back and no one
<ce>                has heard anything of %g2 since. Recently some reports
<ce>                have surfaced regarding a noble whos personal guard
<ce>                have been seen wearing very high quality armor that 
<ce>                the guild smiths think sounds very much like it could
<ce>                very well be %g3 work which would be strange for someone
<ce>                who's been missing for so long - something's fishy here.
<ce> 
<ce>                Maybe you could head over there and investigate?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                Well I suppose you're just too busy to drop
<ce>                everything to go and investigate every silly
<ce>                rumor that surfaces, but we really thought
<ce>                this one was worth the effort to investigate 
<ce>                otherwise we wouldn't have mentioned it.
<ce>
<ce>                I'm sure someone else will be interested.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                Good show, %pct. We're convinced that this is worthwhile
<ce>                investigating further. Head over to _fort_ in __fort_
<ce>                and see what you can find.
<ce>
<ce>                Hopefully it will lead you to _armorer_.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                   _armorer_? Where is %g? Why haven't
<ce>                    you brought %g2 back yet? If you
<ce>                      would save %g3 life, go now!

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                   _armorer_! You are alive and well!
<ce>                    %pcf, I owe you a debt that can
<ce>                   never be fully repaid. This modest
<ce>                     reward is the least that I can
<ce>                               give you.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
<ce>                The guards over at the _fort_
<ce>                in __fort_ have such fancy 
<ce>                armor. I wonder where they get such 
<ce>                workmanship?

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
<ce>                You're that %ra that rescued the master
<ce>                armorer _armorer_ from 
<ce>                __fort_. Bloody nobility, think
<ce>                they can treat commoners like dirt and
<ce>                get away with it. Praise be for champions
<ce>                like you.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
<ce>                  The savior of my child! I thank you
<ce>                   and _armorer_ thanks you for saving
<ce>                       %g3 life. Bless you %pcf.

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>                   My child _armorer_ is dead because
<ce>                 of you! Never darken my doorway again.

QuestLogEntry: [1010]
On %qdt:
 _qgiver_ of the Fighters Guild in ___qgiver_
 told me of some rumors regarding a master armorer
 called _armorer_ who has not been seen 
 for a long time.
 I've decided to investigate __fort_ in 
 ____fort_
 to see if I can find out what's going on and 
 whether or not it's connected with %g3 disapearance.

Message: 1020
<ce>[A guard to your left speaks to you as you enter..]
<ce>
Hey, what are you doing here %ra? Yes, over here on your
left. 
You had better go and speak to the captain, _captain_, 
immediately! He's further down this way, then to the
right, in the big room.

Message: 1021
<ce>[A guard behind you sees you speaking and shouts..]
<ce>
Hey, what are you doing in there here %ra? You have made
a very big mistake, we don't take kindly to trespassing.
You will not leave here alive...

Message: 1022
<ce>[As you slice through yet another of their number, the lord shouts..]
<ce>
Holy gods above, this %ra's a bloody Daedra in human form or
something...  EVERYONE STOP!
We surrender %pcn. 
Take _armorer_ and go, he's not worth losing this many people
for, no matter how good the armor is.

Message: 1023
Ouch. You're going to die for that, %ra!

Message: 1024
__fort_ is no longer on alert for you, and have locked the doors.
You have failed to rescue _armorer_ from his predicament in the
____fort_.


-- Lord
Message: 1030
You dare to speak to me without permission? 
Guards, chase this idiot out of here!

Message: 1031
So, you're here from the Fighters Guild %pcf? I'm sure my
captain has told you to behave yourself, see that you do so
else my guards get more training.
Does the the guild need help from us with something?
I might consider it for a large fee.
Come on, what do you want? Out with it!

Message: 1032
Who makes our armor? Haha. Well, who made your armour, %ra?
That's a bit of an impertinent question, but there's a simple
answer: we have our own armorer, of course.
Does that surprise you, that we have such a fine smith all
the way out here in the middle of nowhere? You city types
are so arrogant. No, he doesn't want to work for anyone
else, and I wont allow him to freelance. You're out of luck.

Message: 1033
Get lost.

Message: 1034
And what you gonna do bout it, %ra?
I'll release _armorer_ for 150,000 gold. Haha.
Can you afford him?

Message:  1035
Okay you can take _armorer_ with you, we're going to miss his
craftmanship but I know when the game is up. 
I suggest that you don't ever cross our path again, %pcf.


-- Captain
Message: 1040
Who are you? What business do you have with us, %ra?
You say you're a high ranking member of the Fighters Guild?
Well we have no issues with the guild so let's keep
it that way, eh? 
You may wander our fort freely and
speak with our lord. But, %pcf, don't cause any trouble
or do anything stupid as we wont hesitate to cut you down,
representative of the Fighters Guild or not.

Message: 1041
Where do we get such fine quality armor? Well you're a nosey 
%ra aren't you? I'm not going to answer that, ask our lord, 
but I suggest you tread carefully.

Message: 1042
You want _armorer_? No!

Message:  1043
Just take _armorer_ and leave us be. 
I don't ever want to see you again.


-- Armorer
Message: 1050
Who the hell are you? Go away, or you'll get us both killed.
Heavens above leave damn you, before the guards see you.

Message: 1051
<ce>[He glances nervously over your shoulder as you speak..]
<ce>
Who the hell are you? Go away, or you'll get me into trouble.
I don't want to be seen talking to you.

Message: 1052
I overheard a guard saying that you were asking the lord about
me. Franky, I'm amazed you're still alive, and even more surprised
you can wander freely about the place. Seems like it might be safe
to talk to you after all.
I'm _armorer_ and I'm trapped here, %pcf. Been here for nearly
two years now, making armor for these damned marauders. Oh, don't
let them fool you, their 'lord' is no noble. No, he's led his
band of renegades for years and they cleared out and setup camp
in this fort a few years back. They use it as a base, since it's 
pretty isolated up here in the mountains, they can operate from
here with relative impunity.

Message: 1053
How did I end up trapped here you ask? Gambling and drinking.
After my wife died and my daughter married, I decided to travel
some while I still could. So I sold my forge, hung up my tools
and travelled around for several months before ending up in
these mountains. One night I was too deep in my cups, as I was
missing my wife something fierce, and started gambling with
some local lord. Seemed more like a ruffian, but he had money.
Ended up with quite the debt to this 'lord' and we came to an
arrangement where I would work crafting armor for him and his men
to pay off the debt. 
Three months, it was only supposed to be for
three months. When the time was up and I started preparing to
leave, they surrounded me and told me I was goin nowhere.
I knew I couldn't fight my way out alone, so started to make
plans to sneak out and escape, but the captain came and made
it very clear that if I were to go missing, that my daughter
would die. This cursed 'lord' has paid the Dark Brotherhood
for a contract on her, to be carried out on his word if I go
missing. That damnable cutthroat son of a bitch knew he had
me, and I've been here ever since. 
She's all I have left now since my wife died, and lives with
her husband farming peacfully. I'll never let her come to harm
which means I am trapped here in servitude until I die unless
some miracle occurs.

Message: 1058
My god %ra, you're crazy! You'll never beat a whole garrison
by yourself. Dibella have mercy on your soul.

Message: 1059
Great, thanks %pcf. Let's get the hell out of here!


-- Contact
Message: 1060
Welcome to __guild_ master %pcn. My name is
_contact_ and I'm very happy to see you indeed, 
as the situation is a rather perplexing one to 
say the least.
<ce>
We've been hearing rumors of a local noble whose soldiers 
and personal guard have been seen clad in unusually fine 
armor. Thing is no one knows anything much about
this 'noble', where he resides or what family they're
from. I've been looking into the matter for a while now,
and have found three reliable locals who've seen them
firsthand.

Message: 1061
I've taken the liberty of making inquiries with a local
group of trackers about tracking down these soldiers and
their mysterious leader. Unfortunately expertise like 
this doesn't come cheap however, and it will cost 7000 gold 
to engage their services. 
<ce>
Alternatively, you could try to search for the location
yourself. I can tell you what the three reliable eye-witnesses 
told me which is all we have to go on.
<ce>
So would you like me to employ the trackers? I'll obviously
need you to provide the 7000 gold to cover their price.

-arrange for you to meet the three 
-witnesses and listen to their accounts firsthand.

Message: 1062
Alright then, it is a large sum so I understand not wanting
to spend that much. Here you go:
1) East of __guild_
2) South of Hawkwing Orchard
3) North East of the Masterhart Graveyard
Good luck and let me know if you need any help once you
find them and hopefully a bit more about the situation.

Message: 1063
Alright then, I'll get in touch with them and check they
are not busy with another job. Please return in a couple
of hours with the money.

Message: 1064
Good news, %pcf, the trackers have agreed to take on this
task for us and I'll paid them 1000 gold to cover expenses
to get started immediately.
<ce>
They'll get the remainder once they've discovered the 
location for us. They reckon it will take a week, so
please rest and prepare in the meantime.

Message:  1065
<ce>             You're approached by a young boy who smiles in
<ce>             recognition and does't ask your name before handing
<ce>             you a letter, then swiftly runs off into the town.
                                     <--->
<ce>             A letter is pressed into your hand. You spin
<ce>            to see who gave it to you. You catch a glimpse
<ce>                of livery that vanishes into the crowd.
                                     <--->
<ce>              A girl steps forward saying "Letter for you
<ce>                     %pcn," and hands you a note.

Message: 1066
%pcn,
 
    Great news, the trackers we employed have found where
the noble and his warriors are. Turns out they've taken up
residence in an old fortified mansion somewhere east of 
__guild_. It's in the hills way off the beaten track, 
and miles away from anywhere.
<ce>
    They must have re-built the place somewhat, as by all 
accounts it's been rundown for several generations to the 
point where most local people are not even aware of its 
existence at all. 
<ce>
    The place is called __fort_ and I've enclosed
a map of how to reach it. Good luck and let me know if
you need any help once you uncover a bit more about the 
situation.
 
<ce>                           Yours sincerely,
 
<ce>                            _contact_

Message: 1067
What? A Dark Brotherhood contract on his daughter?
That's obcene!

Message: 1068
I have no idea what to do.
