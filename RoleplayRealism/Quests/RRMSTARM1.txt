<ce>                    %pcf, I owe you a debt that can

<ce>                in __fort_ have such fancy

On %qdt:
 I met with _contact_ of the Fighters Guild
 in ___contact_ who told me about the rumors regarding 
 a master armorer called _armorer_ who has not been seen 
 for a long time.
 I'm investigating to see if I can find out where these
 troops with fine armor are from, what's going on, and 
 whether or not it's connected with %g3 disapearance.

Message: 1011
on %qdt:
 I have found the armorer, _armorer_. He is
 trapped at __fort_ in servitude to a noble called
 _lord_. He and his troops seem to be nothing
 more than brigands and renegades, and you suspect this
 lord is probably the discraced or iligitimate son of
 some noble family somewhere. 
 They are keeping the smith from leaving by threatening
 his daughter by way of a contract with the Dark
 Brotherhood. Fighting the entire garrison at the fort 
 is unlikely to be possible so I need to get hold of 
 this contract to free _armorer_ from the villanous 
 clutches of _lord_. Alternatively, he has agreed to 
 let the smith go if I pay the ridiculous sum of a 
 million gold.

 Message: 1012
 on %qdt:
  At a meeting with a representative of the Dark
  Brotherhood arranged by _contact_,
  I discovered that the contract is unsanctioned and
  off the books, as the brotherhood are rarely
  interested in contracts on peasant wormen to use
  for blackmailing smiths. Due to my reputation with
  them and my high rank in the Fighters Guild, they 
  are going to get the contract to me within the week
  after dealing with this renegate brother. Whoever
  they are, they're about to have a very bad day.

  the contract myself on the understanding that I
  do it quietly without hurting any other members
  in the process. If I do, there will be costly
  consequences.
  I was told that I could find them at
  __dbHideout_ in the _dbHideout_.

<ce>[A guard to your left speaks to you as you enter..]
<ce>
Hey, what are you doing here %ra? Yes, over here on your
left. 
You had better go and speak to _captain_ immediately! 
He's further down this way, then to the right, in the big room.

Message: 1021
<ce>[A guard behind you sees you speaking and shouts..]
<ce>
Hey, what are you doing in there here %ra? You have made
a very big mistake, we don't take kindly to trespassing.
You will not leave here alive...

Message: 1022
<ce>[As you slice through yet another of their number, the lord shouts..]
<ce>
Holy gods above, this %ra's a bloody Daedra in human form or
something...  EVERYONE STOP!
We surrender %pcn. 
Take _armorer_ and go, he's not worth losing this many people
for, no matter how good the armor is.

Message: 1023
Ouch. You're going to die for that, %ra!

Message: 1024

You have failed to rescue _armorer_ from his predicament in the
____fort_.

Message: 1025
The warriors of __fort_ and their leader are enraged and will
be searching for you for the next couple of days

Message: 1026
You've arrived at __fort_ out here in the hills way off the
beaten track and miles away from anywhere else. They must 
have re-built the place from a semi-ruin, as you can see 
signs of repairs everywhere. There are also indications that
a large group are living at the fort, and some significant
building work has taken place. You suspect the fort has had
it's cellars converted to barracks. This place is likely to
be more dangerous than it might appear at first glance.

Message: 1030
You dare to speak to me without permission? 
Guards, chase this idiot out of here!

Message: 1031
So, you're here from the Fighters Guild %pcf? I'm sure my
captain has told you to behave yourself, see that you do so
else my guards get more training.
Does the the guild need help from us with something?
I might consider it for a large fee.
Come on, what do you want? Out with it!

Message: 1032
Who makes our armor? Haha. Well, who made your armour, %ra?
That's a bit of an impertinent question, but there's a simple
answer: we have our own armorer, of course.
Does that surprise you, that we have such a fine smith all
the way out here in the middle of nowhere? You city types
are so arrogant. No, he doesn't want to work for anyone
else, and I wont allow him to freelance. You're out of luck.

Message: 1033
Get lost.

Message: 1034
And what you gonna do bout it, %ra?
I'll release _armorer_ for, say, a million gold. How about 
that, haha.
Can you afford him? Let's see if you can bring that much gold.

Message: 1035
Nice, I'm surprised you could get so much gold.

Message: 1036
WHat! How the hell did you get hold of that. Crap!

Message: 1037
Okay you can take _armorer_ with you, we're going to miss his
craftmanship but I know when the game is up. 
I suggest that you don't ever cross our path again, %pcf.


-- Captain
Message: 1040
Who are you? What business do you have with us, %ra?
You say you're a high ranking member of the Fighters Guild?
Well we have no issues with the guild so let's keep
it that way, eh? 
You may wander our fort freely and
speak with our lord. But, %pcf, don't cause any trouble
or do anything stupid as we wont hesitate to cut you down,
representative of the Fighters Guild or not.

Message: 1041
Where do we get such fine quality armor? Well you're a nosey 
%ra aren't you? I'm not going to answer that, ask our lord, 
but I suggest you tread carefully.

Message: 1042
You want _armorer_? No!

Message:  1043
Just take _armorer_ and leave us be. 
I don't ever want to see you again.


-- Armorer
Message: 1050
Who the hell are you? Go away, or you'll get us both killed.
Heavens above leave damn you, before the guards see you.

Message: 1051
<ce>[He glances nervously over your shoulder as you speak..]
<ce>
Who the hell are you? Go away, or you'll get me into trouble.
I don't want to be seen talking to you.

Message: 1052
I overheard a guard saying that you were asking the lord about
me. Franky, I'm amazed you're still alive, and even more surprised
you can wander freely about the place. Seems like it might be safe
to talk to you after all.
I'm _armorer_ and I'm trapped here, %pcf. Been here for nearly
two years now, making armor for these damned marauders. Oh, don't
let them fool you, their 'lord' is no noble. No, he's led his
band of renegades for years and they cleared out and setup camp
in this fort a few years back. They use it as a base, since it's 
pretty isolated up here in the mountains, they can operate from
here with relative impunity.

Message: 1053
How did I end up trapped here you ask? Gambling and drinking.
After my wife died and my daughter married, I decided to travel
some while I still could. So I sold my forge, hung up my tools
and travelled around for several months before ending up in
these mountains. One night I was too deep in my cups, as I was
missing my wife something fierce, and started gambling with
some local lord. Seemed more like a ruffian, but he had money.
Ended up with quite the debt to this 'lord' and we came to an
arrangement where I would work crafting armor for him and his men
to pay off the debt. 
Three months, it was only supposed to be for
three months. When the time was up and I started preparing to
leave, they surrounded me and told me I was goin nowhere.
I knew I couldn't fight my way out alone, so started to make
plans to sneak out and escape, but the captain came and made
it very clear that if I were to go missing, that my daughter
would die. This cursed 'lord' has paid the Dark Brotherhood
for a contract on her, to be carried out on his word if I go
missing. That damnable cutthroat son of a bitch knew he had
me, and I've been here ever since. 
She's all I have left now since my wife died, and lives with
her husband farming peacfully. I'll never let her come to harm
which means I am trapped here in servitude until I die unless
some miracle occurs.

Message: 1058
My god %ra, you're crazy! You'll never beat a whole garrison
by yourself. Dibella have mercy on your soul.

Message: 1059
Great, thanks %pcf. Let's get the hell out of here!


-- Guild Contact
Message: 1060
Welcome to __guild_ master %pcn. My name is
_contact_ and I'm very happy to see you indeed, 
as the situation is a rather perplexing one to 
say the least.
<ce>
We've been hearing rumors of a local noble whose soldiers 
and personal guard have been seen clad in unusually fine 
armor. Thing is no one knows anything much about
this 'noble', where he resides or what family they're
from. I've been looking into the matter for a while now,
and have found three reliable locals who've seen them
firsthand.

Message: 1061
I've taken the liberty of making inquiries with a local
group of trackers about tracking down these soldiers and
their mysterious leader. Unfortunately expertise like 
this doesn't come cheap however, and it will cost 7000 gold 
to engage their services. 
<ce>
Alternatively, you could try to search for the location
yourself. I can tell you what the three reliable eye-witnesses 
told me which is all we have to go on.
<ce>
So would you like me to employ the trackers? I'll obviously
need you to provide the 7000 gold to cover their price.

-arrange for you to meet the three 
-witnesses and listen to their accounts firsthand.

Message: 1062
Alright then, it is a large sum so I understand not wanting
to spend that much. Here you go:
1) East of __guild_
2) South of Hawkwing Orchard
3) North East of the Masterhart Graveyard
Good luck and let me know if you need any help once you
find them and hopefully a bit more about the situation.
Tread carefully, I doubt that they'll be very forgiving if 
you anger them.

Message: 1063
Alright then, I'll get in touch with them and check they
are not busy with another job. Please return with the 
gold as soon as you can, if you want to proceed.

Message: 1064
Good news, %pcf, the trackers have agreed to take on this
task for us and I've paid them 1000 gold to cover expenses
to get started immediately.
<ce>
They'll get the remainder once they've discovered the 
location for us. They reckon it will take a week, so
please rest and prepare in the meantime. I'll send a
letter upon their return.

Message:  1065
<ce>             You're approached by a young boy who smiles in
<ce>             recognition and does't ask your name before handing
<ce>             you a letter, then swiftly runs off into the town.
                                     <--->
<ce>             A letter is pressed into your hand. You spin
<ce>            to see who gave it to you. You catch a glimpse
<ce>                of livery that vanishes into the crowd.
                                     <--->
<ce>              A girl steps forward saying "Letter for you
<ce>                     %pcn," and hands you a note.

Message: 1066
%pcn,
 
    Great news, the trackers we employed have found where
the noble and his warriors are. Turns out they've taken up
residence in an old fortified mansion somewhere east of 
__guild_. It's in the hills way off the beaten track, 
and miles away from anywhere.
<ce>
    They must have re-built the place somewhat, as by all 
accounts it's been rundown for several generations to the 
point where most local people are not even aware of its 
existence. 
<ce>
    The place is called __fort_ and I've enclosed
a map of how to reach it. Good luck and let me know if
you need any help once you uncover a bit more about the 
situation. Tread carefully, I doubt that they'll be very
forgiving if you anger them.
 
<ce>                           Yours sincerely,
 
<ce>                            _contact_

Message: 1067
What? A Dark Brotherhood contract on his daughter?
That's obcene! I can setup a meeting for you with
the brotherhood for you, as they should be willing
to at least meet a master of our guild.
Go to _dbTavern_ over in __dbTavern_, a representative
will be waiting there for you. Be careful around 
the dark brothers, they are not to be trifled with.

Message: 1068
I hope you're able to retrieve the contract and 
free _armorer_, %pcf. Remember, be careful around
the dark brothers, we want to keep on their good
side for the sake of the guild.


-- Dark Brother contact
Message: 1080
Hello.

Message: 1081
You are a friend of the brotherhood, so we'll deal 
with this renegade swiftly and deliver the contract
to you in a few days.

Message: 1082
We'll have to deal with this renegade brother at some point
and the contract will be void, but we don't feel any urgency
regarding the situation. There are many more important
machinations and intrigues to deal with first. You will
find this brother at _dbHideout_ in __dbHideout_, you've
permission to go and deal with them yourself. Be warned, 
don't harm any others of our order while doing this, else 
we'll hunt you down to exact revenge.
Given the circumstances we may make an exception for a
hefty price, but if you can't pay then you will die.
