QuestFail:  [1003]
__fort_ is no longer on alert for you, and have locked the doors.
You have failed to rescue _armorer_ from his predicament in the
____fort_.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>Excellent work Master, I'm so pleased that 
you managed to rescue _armorer_ from 
__fort_ all the way out here in the
____fort_. I feel much better now that the
sitution has been resolved so satisfactorily.
<ce>
It's been an absolute privilege to watch someone 
of your experience and expertise at work, Master 
%pcl. I can see why you're a master of the guild. 
Please do pop in and say hello if you're ever up in
these mountains again, won't you?
<ce>
[You make a note of where _armorer_ said he was 
headed to in your notebook, and say goodbye]

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
<ce> The guards over at the __fort_
<ce> in ____fort_ have such fancy 
<ce> armor. I wonder where they get such 
<ce> workmanship?

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
<ce> You're that %ra that rescued the master
<ce> armorer _armorer_ from 
<ce> __fort_. Bloody nobility. Think
<ce> they can treat commoners like dirt and
<ce> get away with it. Praise be for champions
<ce> like you who help the common folk.

On %qdt:
 I met with _contact_ of the Fighters Guild
 in __guild_ who told me about the rumors regarding 
 a master armorer called _armorer_ who has not 
 been seen for a long time.
    I'm investigating to see if I can find out where 
 these troops with fine armor are from, what's going 
 on, and whether or not it's connected with %g3 
 disappearance.

Message: 1011
on %qdt:
 I have found the armorer, _armorer_. He is
 trapped at __fort_ in servitude to a noble called
 _lord_. He and his troops seem to be nothing
 more than brigands and renegades, and you suspect this
 lord is probably the disgraced or illegitimate son of
 some noble family somewhere. 
    They are keeping the smith trapped by taking out a 
 contract with the Dark Brotherhood and threatening his 
 daughter with death. Fighting the entire garrison at the 
 fort is unlikely to be possible, so I need to get hold of 
 this contract to free _armorer_ from the villainous 
 clutches of _lord_. Maybe I should pay my guild
 contact in __guild_ a visit to see if a meeting with 
 the Dark Brotherhood can be arranged.
    Alternatively, _lord_ has agreed to release
the smith if I pay the ridiculous sum of a million 
gold pieces.

Message: 1012
on %qdt:
 My guild contact in __guild_, _contact_, 
 has arranged a meeting for me with the Dark Brotherhood
 over in __dbTavern_.
    They will wait for you in the tavern called
 _dbTavern_. Look for someone called 
 _dbContact_.

Message: 1013
on %qdt:
 At a meeting with a representative of the Dark
 Brotherhood I discovered that this contract is 
 unsanctioned. Due to my good standing with the 
 Dark Brotherhood, they are going to deal with 
 this renegade swiftly, retrieving the contract 
 and delivering it directly to me within the week. 
 Whoever this transgressing member is, they're 
 about to regret ever having taken money from 
 _lord_ against the code of the brotherhood!

Message: 1014
on %qdt:
 At a meeting with a representative of the Dark
 Brotherhood I discovered that this contract is 
 unsanctioned. The brotherhood met with me out 
 of respect for my rank in the Fighters Guild, 
 but they are not going to deal with this 
 transgressing brother until they're ready to do 
 so, which is not quick enough for my purposes. 
    However, I have been permitted to retrieve 
 the contract myself on the understanding that I 
 do it quietly without hurting any other members 
 in the process. If I do, there will be costly 
 consequences. I should be able to find the 
 renegade member at __dbHideout_ 
 in _dbHideout_.

Message: 1015
on %qdt:
 Thankfully I was able to release _armorer_ from
 his entrapment by _lord_ at _fort_.
 He has headed south to a small town called Pjiga in
 the Mournoth region to set up a new forge and teach
 an apprentice.

Message: 1016

Message: 1018
on %qdt:
 My guild contact in __guild_, _contact_, 
 has employed some local trackers to locate the source of 
 these well-armored warriors the locals are talking about.
 My contact will send me a letter once the trackers return,
 which should be in around 5 days time.

Message: 1019
on %qdt:
 My guild contact in __guild_, _contact_, 
 has given me his notes made from the eyewitness accounts
 of three reliable witnesses, hopefully giving clues to
 the wherabouts of the mysterious troops and their leader.

Message: 1020
<ce>[A guard to your left speaks to you as you enter]
<ce>
<ce>Hey, who are you? What are you doing here and what do you
<ce>want %ra? Yes, over here on your left, are you deaf?
<ce>
<ce>You had better go and speak to _captain_ immediately!
<ce> 
<ce>Continue further down the hall this way, then go to the 
<ce>right, into the large hall. He wears a yellow tunic with
<ce>a red cape, you can't miss him. Keep your weapons sheathed
<ce>and don't try any funny stuff, or we'll have your guts
<ce>for garters.

Message: 1021
<ce>[A guard behind you sees you speaking and calls out]
<ce>
<ce>Hey, what are you doing in there? You've made a big 
<ce>mistake, we don't take kindly to trespassers here.
<ce>
<ce>You'll not leave here alive %ra...

Message: 1022
<ce>[As you slice through yet another of their number, the lord shouts]
<ce>
Holy gods above, this bloody %ra's a Daedra in human form or
something...  EVERYONE STOP!
<ce>
We surrender Master %pcl. 
<ce>
Take _armorer_ and just leave, he's not worth the
loss of so many warriors for, no matter how good the 
armor he makes is.

Message: 1023
Argghhh. You're going to pay in blood for that, %ra!

Message: 1024
You've arrived back at __fort_ but you failed to retrieve the
contract from the renegade Dark Brother. You only have two
options left to rescue _armorer_, either pay the 1 million gold 
or fight an entire garrison of soldiers. Neither option is
particularly appealing.

Message: 1025
The warriors of __fort_ and their leader are enraged and will
be searching for you for the next couple of days

Message: 1026
You've arrived at __fort_ out here in the hills, way off the
beaten track and miles away from anywhere else. They must 
have rebuilt the place from an old ruin, as you can see 
signs of repairs everywhere. There are also indications that
a large group is living at the fort, and some significant
construction has taken place. You suspect the fort has had
its cellars converted to a barracks. This place is likely to
be more dangerous than it might appear at first glance.

Message: 1027
<ce>Eyewitness reports regarding the finely armored warriors 
<ce>seen in the region recently from _contact_.
<ce>
<ce>1: While out with his sheep, a shepherd from Moorton Farm
<ce>had a few sheep 'confiscated' by a group of well-armored 
<ce>'knights'. The sheep pastures are to the east of their
<ce>farm and the warriors headed off that way.
<ce>
<ce>2: A well dressed, but rude '_captain_' insisted on 
<ce>buying all the wine from the Hawking Orchard cheaply. He 
<ce>was backed up by several rough looking men in fine armor. 
<ce>They appeared to take the wine barrels towards the south.
<ce>
<ce>3: A funeral procession headed for the Masterhart Graveyard
<ce>was forced off the road by a unit of well-armed men heading
<ce>northeast. They showed absolutely no concern or respect.

Message: 1030
You dare to speak to me without permission? 
Guards, chase this idiot out of here!

Message: 1031
So, you're here from the Fighters Guild? I'm sure my
captain has told you to behave yourself, see that you do so
else my guards get more training.
Does the guild need help from us with something?
I might consider it for a large fee.
Come on, what do you want? Out with it!

Message: 1032
Who makes our armor? Haha. Well, who made your armor, %ra?
That's a bit of an impertinent question, but there's a simple
answer: we have our own armorer, of course.
Does that surprise you, that we have such a fine smith all
the way out here in the middle of nowhere? You city types
are so arrogant. No, he doesn't want to work for anyone
else, and I won't allow him to freelance. You're out of luck.

Message: 1033
Stop bothering me if you have nothing new to say.

Message: 1034
And what you gonna do 'bout it, %ra?
I'll release _armorer_ for, say, a million gold. How about 
that, haha.
Can you afford him? Let's see if you can bring that much gold.

Message: 1035
What? You actually got... hmmm, yes, that's about enough. 
All right then, I’ll release _armorer_. You got quite the
bargain there guildmaster! Now take him and get out of here.
<ce>
[He can barely contain his amusement and mirth]

Message: 1036
What? How the hell did you get hold of that? Curse the damn
brotherhood. Okay, fine, take _armorer_ with you! We're going 
to miss his craftmanship but I know when the game is up.
Your seniority within the Fighters Guild is the only reason 
you’re leaving here alive. I suggest that you don't ever 
cross our path again, %ra.

Message: 1037
Get out of here. Begone!

Message: 1038
You were warned to not approach _lord_ before
speaking to _captain_ first.
Do you want to ignore this advice?

Message: 1040
Who are you? What business do you have with us, %ra?
Well, well, a Master from the Fighters Guild you say?
We have no issues with the guild so let's keep
it that way, eh? 
You may wander our fort freely and
speak with our lord. But, %pcf, don't cause any trouble
or do anything stupid as we won't hesitate to cut you down,
representative of the Fighters Guild or not.

Message: 1041
Where do we get such fine quality armor? Well you're a nosey 
%ra aren't you? I'm not going to answer that, ask our lord, 
but I suggest you tread carefully.

Message: 1042
You want _armorer_? I warn you, _lord_ has become
quite attached to our smith and his craftmanship.

Message:  1043
If not for the beef we would start with the Fighters Guild, 
I would have my men carve you open like a pig. Just take
the damn smith and get out. I don't ever want to see you again.

Message: 1044
Where did you get that from? Damn you, _lord_
is going to be in a bad mood for weeks. Curses on you
and your pox ridden guild. 

Message: 1048
<ce>What are you looking at?
<ce>
<ce>We're watching you, come on, just give us an excuse... 
<ce>We like a good fight.

Message: 1051
<ce>[He glances nervously over your shoulder as you speak..]
<ce>
Who the hell are you? Go away, or you'll get me into trouble.
I can't want to be seen talking to you.

Message: 1052
I overheard a guard saying that you were asking the lord about
me. Franky, I'm amazed you're still alive, and even more surprised
you can wander freely about the place. Seems like it might be safe
to talk to you after all.
I'm _armorer_ and I'm trapped here, Master %pcl. 
<ce>
Been here for nearly
two years now, making armor for these damned bandits. Oh, don't
let them fool you, their 'lord' is no noble. No, he's led his
band of renegades for years and they cleared out and setup camp
in this fort a few years back. They use it as a base, since it's 
pretty isolated up here in the mountains, they can operate from
here with relative impunity.

Message: 1053
How did I end up trapped here you ask? Gambling and drinking.
After my wife died and my daughter married, I decided to travel
some while I still could. So, I sold my forge, hung up my tools
and travelled around for several months before ending up in
these mountains. One night I was too deep in my cups, as I was
missing my wife something fierce, and started gambling with
some local lord. Seemed more like a ruffian, but he had money.
Ended up with quite the debt to this 'lord' and we came to an
arrangement where I would work crafting armor for him and his men
to pay off the debt.

Message: 1054
Three months! It was only supposed to be for three months. 
But when the time was up, and I started preparing to
leave, they surrounded me and told me I was going nowhere.
I knew I couldn't fight my way out alone, so started to make
plans to sneak out and escape, but the captain came and made
it very clear that if I were to go missing, that my daughter
would die. This cursed 'lord' has paid the Dark Brotherhood
for a contract on her, to be carried out on his word if I go
missing. That damnable cutthroat son of a bitch knew he had
me, and I've been here ever since.
She's all I have left now, after my wife passed away, and she
lives with her husband, farming peacefully. I'll never let her 
come to harm, which means I am trapped here in servitude until
I die, unless some miracle occurs.

Message: 1055
How on earth did you get hold of the contract, %pcf?
Bloody hell, that doesn't matter - maybe tell me later, the 
important thing is you've given me my freedom back. Thank 
the heavens, you're my savior. I'll be ready to leave just
as soon as you've shown it to _lord_, so he 
knows his scheme is dead and buried then we can be on our way.

Message: 1058
<ce>%oth %ra, you're crazy! 
<ce>You'll never beat a whole garrison by yourself. 
<ce>Dibella have mercy on your soul.

Message: 1059
<ce>Great, thank you %pcf. 
<ce>I never thought the day would come!
<ce>Let's get the hell out of here.

-- Guild Contact
Message: 1060
Welcome to __guild_ Master %pcl. My name is
_contact_ and I'm very happy to see you indeed, 
as the situation is a rather perplexing one to 
say the least.
<ce>
We've been hearing rumors of a local noble whose soldiers 
and personal guard have been seen clad in unusually fine 
armor. Thing is, no one knows anything much about
this 'noble'. Not where he resides or what family he's
from. I've been looking into the matter for a while now,
and have found three reliable locals who've seen them
firsthand.

Message: 1061
I've taken the liberty of making inquiries with a local
group of trackers about tracking down these soldiers and
their mysterious leader. Unfortunately, expertise like 
this doesn't come cheap however, and it will cost 7000 gold 
to engage their services. 
<ce>
Alternatively, you could try to search for the location
yourself. I can tell you what the three reliable eye-witnesses 
told me, which is all we have to go on.
<ce>
So, would you like me to employ the trackers? I'll obviously
need you to provide the 7000 gold to cover their price.

Message: 1062
Fair enough, it's not a trivial sum so I understand not 
wanting to spend that much. Here you go, here are my
notes made when speaking to the three witnesses.
<ce>
Good luck and let me know if you need any help once you
track down these troops and their leader, and hopefully 
also discover a bit more about the situation. Do tread 
carefully, I doubt that they'll be very forgiving if you 
anger them from the sound of the reports.

Message: 1063
Alright then, I'll get in touch with the trackers and have
them start as soon as you return with the money, assuming 
you still want to proceed. They don't accept letters of 
credit, so you need to bring me gold pieces.

Message: 1064
Thank you Master %pcl. I was afraid I would have to cover
the expenses out of my own meagre pocket.
<ce>
I will contact the trackers and have them start their search 
immediately. They said that with the vague directions and 
such a large and inhospitable area to cover, it would likely
take about a week to cover the area. Once I hear from them,
I will send you a letter with their findings.

Message:  1065
<ce>A youthful redguard, wearing mismatched pieces of worn 
<ce>armor, steps confidently upto you with a letter in his
<ce>calloused hand. 
<ce>"Letter from the Guild, Master %pcl."
        <--->
<ce>A scarred nord woman briskly walks up to you. She shifts
<ce>one of her many weapons aside, pulls out a crumpled letter
<ce>and thrusts it into your hands before striding away.
        <--->
<ce>An armored argonian slithers up to you. They hold up a
<ce>letter in one claw and hiss at you,
<ce>"I erect the spine of greeting, Master %pcl." 
<ce>before passing you the letter. They take a pace
<ce>back, bow, and then swiftly disappear into the crowd.

Message: 1066
Master %pcn,
 
    Great news, the trackers we employed have found where
the noble and his warriors are. Turns out they've taken up
residence in an old fortified monastery somewhere east of 
__guild_. It is in the hills, way off the beaten track, 
and miles away from anywhere.
<ce>
    They must have re-built the place somewhat, as by all 
accounts it's been rundown for several generations to the 
point where most local people are not even aware of its 
existence. 
<ce>
    The place is called __fort_ and I've enclosed
a map of how to reach it. Good luck and let me know if
you need any help once you uncover a bit more about the 
situation. Tread carefully, I doubt that they'll be very
forgiving if you anger them.
 
<ce>                           Yours sincerely,
 
<ce>                            _contact_

Message: 1067
What? A Dark Brotherhood contract on his daughter?
That's obscene! 
I will setup a meeting for you with the brotherhood,
as they should be willing to at least meet with a 
master of our guild out of respect. Whether they
will help you is another matter entirely.
Go to _dbTavern_ over in __dbTavern_, I'll
ensure that a representative will be waiting for 
you. Be careful around the dark brothers, they 
are not to be trifled with.

Message: 1068
I hope you're able to retrieve the contract and 
free _armorer_, %pcf. Remember, be careful around
the dark brothers, we want to keep on their good
side for the sake of the guild.

Message: 1069
Excellent work Master %pcl! 
<ce>
So you have retrieved the contract and now you can free
_armorer_. That's fantastic news.
<ce>
Bring him here, so we can help arrange a nice quiet 
place for him to live. I'm sure we can find somewhere
suitable.

-- Rescued armorer
Message: 1070
Welcome to __guild_, _armorer_. Please accept our help
after your ordeal.
<ce>
Master %pcl, we will help him get back on his feet and
set up home with a new forge in a small town somewhere 
nice and quiet.
<ce>
So, where would you like to settle down, _armorer_?
<ce>
We're assuming someplace far away from the 
____guild_...

Message: 1071
I'm not sure. To tell you the truth I'm just grateful
to be out of the cursed place and out of 
_lord_'s clutches at last.
<ce>
I'm forever in your debt Master %pcl!
<ce>
Hmm, I think that I will settle somewhere peaceful with
a new forge and finally take on an apprentice. I really
should pass on my skills before I get too old, you know. 
I'm certainly tired of crafting armor myself after the 
past couple of years, and teaching will make a nice change.
<ce>
I can always make an exception for you though %pcf.
Although I can't ever repay you for rescuing me, I can 
forge custom armor for you once I'm settled down. Please
drop by and see me anytime.
<ce>
So which direction shall I go? Hmmm, what do you think, 
Master %pcl?
<ce>
Shall I head West, South, or maybe to the warmer South West?

Message: 1072
So do you think I should head South to find 
a place to settle?

Message: 1073
What do you think about me heading West to find 
somewhere to settle?

Message: 1074
Okay then maybe I should head South-West and find
somewhere nice and warm to settle?

Message: 1075
Okay then %pcf, I'm going to head south and settle in
a small town called Pjiga in the Mournoth region. Please
drop by any time you're in the area or if you need some
particular armor crafted. You will always be welcome in
my forge.
Goodbye and thanks again!

Message: 1076
Okay then %pcf, I'm going to head west and settle in
a small town called Penmore in Glenpoint. Please do 
drop by any time you're in the area or if you need some
particular armor crafted. You will always be welcome at
my forge.
Goodbye and thanks again!

Message: 1077
Okay then %pcf, I'm going to head south west to the sun
and sand to settle in a small place called Paponirea in
Tigonus. Please drop by any time you're in the area or

be welcome at my home.
Goodbye and thanks again!


-- Dark Brother contact
Message: 1080
<ce>Greetings Master %pcl. Thanks to you and your guild 
<ce>for bringing this to our attention. We were previously 
<ce>unaware of this contract which you say has been taken 
<ce>out on a peasant woman as a means of blackmailing her
<ce>father, another commoner of no real consequence, 
<ce>however skilled he may be at crafting armor. 
<ce>
<ce>Although the uninformed may think the Dark Brotherhood
<ce>a simple group of killers for hire, nothing could be
<ce>farther from the truth. A contract is a holy communion
<ce>between us and our Dark Queen. To allow it to be used 
<ce>for leverage in labor dispute is beneath us.
<ce>
<ce>Our wayward member will have known this and, if they  
<ce>truly followed our code, would have refused the money.
<ce>It seems that greed has corrupted them enough to sell
<ce>unsanctioned contracts in the name of the Brotherhood.

Message: 1081
You do not need to sully your own blade with this renegades’
blood, %pcn. For you, as you're a good friend of the 
brotherhood, we will deal with this matter swiftly
and deliver the heretical contract to you within the next
few days. We ask simply that when you have no more need of 
this document, you will destroy this affront to our order.

Message: 1082
We will have to deal with this renegade brother at some point
and the contract will be void, but we do not feel any urgency
regarding the situation. There are many more important 
machinations and intrigues to deal with more urgently. 
You will find this brother at _dbHideout_ 
in __dbHideout_.
You have our permission to go and deal with our wayard member. 
Be warned, however, do not harm any others of our order while
doing this, else we will hunt you down and exact vengence.
<ce>
Given the circumstances, we may make an exception for a hefty
price, but if you are unable to pay, then there's nothing we
can do and you will die.

Message: 1083
<ce> Reaching into your pack for something,
<ce> you spy a note that was not there before.
        <--->
<ce> You feel a parchment slip into your hand and hear
<ce> the sound of footsteps scampering away. There is 
<ce> no other sign of the mysterious courier.
        <--->
<ce>A girl steps forward saying
<ce>"Letter for you %pcn."
<ce>She hands you a note before sprinting away.

Message: 1090
An unsanctioned Dark Brotherhood contract to kill 
_armorer_'s daughter if _lord_ reports that he has
fled __fort_!

Message: 1091
You engage the renegade in conversation, putting them at
ease using your knowledge of street level language and
customs. As soon as their guard drops, you skillfully
make a blindingly fast strike to the throat, crushing
their windpipe. As the body sags, you catch it and
quietly lower it to the floor. No one else has been
alerted, so now you can retrieve the contract and leave. 

Message: 1092
You sneak behind the renegade without them seeing you.
As soon as you are close enough, you skillfully pilfer
the contract without detection.

Message: 1093
You sneak behind the renegade without them detecting you.
As soon as you are close enough, you skillfully stab
them through the throat. As they sag to the floor,
gurgling blood, you catch it and quietly lower it to the
floor. No one else has been alerted, so now you can now
retrieve the contract and leave. 

Message: 1094
[You try to catch the renegade out, but are not skilled enough]
<ce>
You should not have come here. I don't like unexpected
guests. My mates and I will cut you into little pieces.
