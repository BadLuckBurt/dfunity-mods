<ce>You have paid your debt to the Dark Brotherhood and they
have stopped sending assasins.

 While retrieving a contract I hurt some other members
 in the process. The DB will be after me, hopefully I
 can pay them off.

Hello. blah blah

Message: 1081
You are a good friend of the brotherhood, so we'll deal 
with this renegade swiftly and deliver the contract 
directly to you within a few days.

Message: 1082
We'll have to deal with this renegade brother at some point
and the contract will be void, but we don't feel any urgency
regarding the situation. There are many more important
machinations and intrigues to deal with first. You will
find this brother at _dbHideout_ in __dbHideout_,
you've permission to go and deal with them. Be warned
however, don't harm any others of our order while doing this,
else we'll hunt you down and exact revenge.
<ce>
Given the circumstances we may make an exception for a
hefty price, but if you can't pay then you will die.

<ce> Reaching into your pack for something,
<ce> you spy a note that wasn't there before.
        <--->
<ce> You feel a parchment slip into your hand and hear
<ce> the sound of footsteps scampering away. There is 
<ce> no other sign of the mysterious courier.

Message: 1090
You have injured another member of the Dark Brotherhood
which you were warned against doing. They will be coming
for you to exact a price. Master of a guild or not, you
don't cross the brotherhood. You'd better visit a bank
after finishing up here to ensure you can pay with gold 
rather than your blood! (100,000 gold should cover it)

Message: 1096
An enforcer from the Dark Brotherhood corners you and
requests you pay 100,000 gold to compensate for the
members you murdered when retrieving the contract.
You are glad you had the money to pay, as having the
brotherhood after you is not a pleasant situation.

Message: 1097
An enforcer from the Dark Brotherhood corners you and
requests you pay 100,000 gold to compensate for the
members you murdered when retrieving the contract.
Since you can't pay, they signal their nearby comrades
to attack.

Message: 1098
Thank you for compensating the brotherhood with 100,000 
gold, I should be able to smooth things over and call
off the enforcers. Your reputation with us has still 
been damaged, so I suggest you keep out of our way from
now on Master %pcl.

Message: 1099
You need to pay us 100,000 gold to compensate for the
members you murdered when retrieving the contract.
No negotiations, just get the money otherwise you'll
be hounded to your grave, %pcn.
