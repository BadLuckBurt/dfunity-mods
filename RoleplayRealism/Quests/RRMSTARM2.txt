<ce>You've paid your debt to the Dark Brotherhood and 
<ce>they have forgiven your transgressions. You can now stop 
<ce>looking over your shoulder for assassins.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
<ce> I hear the Dark Brotherhood are angry with one of the
<ce> Masters of the Fighters Guild.

 While retrieving a contract I hurt some other members
 in the process. The DB will be after me, hopefully I
 can pay them off with money instead of my own blood.

 I failed to pay my debt to _dbContact_.
 They suggested I may be able to pay off their enforcers
 but the amount is now doubled at 200,000 gold. I had
 better visit a bank and keep one eye over my shoulder.

on %qdt:
 I failed to pay my debt to the Dark Brotherhood twice
 now. They must be asbsolutely furious, and will likely
 keep sending assassins until I am dead. Maybe if I
 ensure I travel with a lot of money, I might get one 
 last chance to pay them off if I am lucky.

    The Dark Brotherhood gave you clear instructions
 not to harm any other of our members when retrieving
 that contract from the renegade. You did not comply,
 whether this was through carelessness or simple
 indifference matters not to us.
<ce>
    You owe us a price, one for which usually the only
 coin acceptable to us is that of blood. However, out 
 of respect for your rank within your guild, and also 
 in thanks for informing us of that blasphemous contract 
 in the first place, we will accept a gold substitute.
<ce>
    Find _dbContact_ and pay 100,000 
 within three weeks if you wish to accept this unusually
 generous offer and live. You will find them over in 
 __dbFront_ at _dbFront_
 in the ____dbFront_. 
<ce>
    If you have not paid after three weeks, then
 the debt must be paid with your blood.

Message: 1021
<ce>You have injured another member of the Dark Brotherhood
<ce>which you were warned against doing. They will be coming
<ce>for you to exact a price. Master of a guild or not, you
<ce>don't cross the brotherhood. You hope that you can pay 
<ce>with gold, rather than your blood! Best to keep alert.

Message: 1022
<ce>You have run out of time to pay the debt to _dbContact_.
<ce>The only hope left is to ensure you have at least 200,000
<ce>on you when their assassins inevitably track you down.

Message: 1030
<ce> Reaching into your pack for something,
<ce> you spy a note that wasn't there before.
        <--->
<ce> You feel a parchment slip into your hand and hear
<ce> the sound of footsteps scampering away. There is 
<ce> no other sign of the mysterious courier.
        <--->
<ce>A young street urchin presses a letter into your
<ce>hand. As you attempt to question him, it becomes
<ce>obvious that he is both deaf and mute. With a 
<ce>wave of frustration you send him on his way.

Message: 1080
<ce>Well, hello there Master %pcl.
<ce>
<ce>Here to pay your debt to the Brotherhood I hope?

Message: 1081
<ce>You have disappointed the Dark Brotherhood in not
<ce>paying the price, which is not wise.
<ce>
<ce>Why have you wasted your one chance to pay me the  
<ce>gold as requested? You need to pay your debt to us to  
<ce>compensate for the members you hurt! The Brotherhood 
<ce>does not let things go, so do not mistake the boon 
<ce>granted in this instance with some kind of leniency.
<ce>
<ce>I suggest you ensure you have double the original amount
<ce>on you when our enforcers track you down and hope they
<ce>accept it. No negotiations, just get the money otherwise 
<ce>you'll be hounded to your grave, %pcl.
<ce>
<ce>Now, get out of here before I give in to my desire to
<ce>teach you the proper respect due the Brotherhood.

Message: 1082
<ce>Thank you for compensating the brotherhood with this 
<ce>gold, I should now be able to smooth things over and 
<ce>call off the enforcers. Your reputation with us has 
<ce>still been damaged though, so I suggest you keep out 
<ce>of our way from for a while Master %pcl. 
<ce>
<ce>The blessings of Mephala be upon you.

Message: 1083
<ce>You havn't got enough money to pay! 
<ce>What the hell are you trying to pull here, %ra?

Message: 1096
<ce>An enforcer from the Dark Brotherhood corners you and
<ce>demands you pay 200,000 gold to compensate for the
<ce>brothers you harmed while retrieving the contract.
<ce>
<ce>You are glad you had the money to pay, as having the
<ce>brotherhood after you is not a pleasant situation,
<ce>and quite detrimental to your health.

Message: 1097
<ce>An enforcer from the Dark Brotherhood corners you and
<ce>demands you pay 200,000 gold to compensate for the
<ce>brothers you harmed while retrieving the contract.
<ce>
<ce>Since you can't pay, they signal the nearby assassins
<ce>to attack.

Message: 1098
<ce>An enforcer from the Dark Brotherhood corners you and
<ce>demands you pay 300,000 gold in compensation, saying
<ce>that this is your last chance.

<ce>of nearby assassins waiting to ambush you to attack.
